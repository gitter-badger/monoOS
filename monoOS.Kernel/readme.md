# monoOS's kernel
This is a linux kernel that downloaded from kernel.org .
The sources is too heavy but I try to upload them. You can download the compiled kernel from here
Or use kernel of your Debian OS or Ubuntu OS.
The Kernel is a simple linux kernel without any modification.

# bzimage
This file is the compiled linux kernel for monoOS.

# make.config
Rename this file to .config.
Download linux sources from kernel.org then copy make.config to the source folder and rename to .config then run "make" command to build kernel.
The only modification is adding monoOS name to the some places otherwise the linux.
