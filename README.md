# monoOS
monoOS is a linux distribution with mono runtimes and framework.

Currently, the Linux kernel and the core is being ready. After this, I will upload them with source codes here.

# Layers
1. Linux Kernel, Modules and Drivers
2. Core: collection of busybox and startup scripts
3. Mono: The C# Runtimes for linux (nearest low-level part to UI)
4. C# Applications and Utilities 
5. The User Interface

# Languages
1. Low-level kernel in Assembly and C++
2. Low-level Runtime in C++
3. High-level framework and applications in C#

# Graphical User Interface
Currently, I dont know how to do this, but I want to use framebuffer and C# Drivers.
Also, you can use X11 Window System abd Gtk#.
